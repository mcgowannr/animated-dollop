  <p>This is a new project that I am starting on in order to become more confidenant in my ablities with
    HTML and CSS. I hope to eventually be able to incorperate Javascript into this project as well.<p>

     <p>I guess I should start by explaining why I am making this project anyway. I figured that the only
       way at getting better at stuff like this would be to get out of my comfort zone. I started dabbling
       with programming languages in a database class I was in (SQL). Why used MicrosoftSQL in the class.
       This was a huge learning curb for me since I had never used visual studio before. After completeing
       that class I figured I would continue with HTML and CSS. The next class in college that I have coming
       up will teach C# and Agile software development.
